Rotate Array
Given an unsorted array arr[] of size N, rotate it by D elements (counter-clockwise). 

Input: 
The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of testcases. First line of eacg test case contains two space separated elements, N denoting the size of the array and an integer D denoting the number size of the rotation. Subsequent line will be the N space separated array elements.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, output the rotated array.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function rotate() which rotates the array by given D elements. The newline is automatically added by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 200
1 <= N <= 107
1 <= D <= N
0 <= arr[i] <= 105

Example:
Input:
2
5 2
1 2 3 4 5 
10 3
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20

Output:
3 4 5 1 2
8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 4 6

Explanation :
Testcase 1: 1 2 3 4 5  when rotated by 2 elements, it becomes 3 4 5 1 2.
Testcase 2: 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20  when rotated by 3 elements, it becomes 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 4 6.
