Check if Linked List is Palindrome 
Given a singly linked list of size N of integers. The task is to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxialliary Space Usage: O(1)  (ie, you should not use the recursive stack space as well)

Hint:


1. To check if linked list is palindrome, you need the data of first n/2 nodes of the the linked list.
2. Just use a data structure called stack to store data of the first n/2 nodes of the linked list.
3. Now, start traversing from mid of the linked list and compare data of the linked list with that on the top of the stack, each time incrementing the middle and popping the top element from the stack.

Alternative approach (without using additional space)
1. Divide list in 2 halves.
2. Reverse the second half.
3. Check whether the 2 small lists are identical.
    (Note : In this particular method, it is a good practise to make input list same as before)
    
    
================================================================

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input contains length of linked list N and next line contains N integers as data of linked list.

Output:
For each test case output will be 1 if the linked list is a palindrome else 0.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function isPalindrome() which takes head as reference as the only parameter and returns true or false if linked list is palindrome or not respectively.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= N <= 50

Example:
Input:
2
3
1 2 1
4
1 2 3 4
Output:
1
0

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The given linked list is 1 2 1 , which is a pallindrome and Hence, the output is 1.
Testcase 2: The given linked list is 1 2 3 4 , which is not a pallindrome and Hence, the output is 0.
