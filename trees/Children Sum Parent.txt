Children Sum Parent 
Given a Binary Tree. Check whether all of its nodes have the value equal to the sum of their child nodes.

Input:
First line of input contains the number of test cases T. For each test case, there will be only a single line of input which is a string representing the tree as described below: 

The values in the string are in the order of level order traversal of the tree where, numbers denotes node values, and a character “N” denotes NULL child.

For example:

 
For the above tree, the string will be: 1 2 3 N N 4 6 N 5 N N 7 N

Output:
Return 1 if the given tree satisfies the given property else return 0.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isSumProperty() that takes the root Node of the Binary Tree as input and returns 1 if all the nodes in the tree satisfy the following properties. Else, it returns 0.
For every node, data value must be equal to the sum of data values in left and right children. Consider data value as 0 for NULL child.  Also, leaves are considered to follow the property.

Expected Time Complexiy: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Data on nodes <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
10 10
1 4 3 5 N
Output:
1
0

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Tree is like:
            10
           /    
        10       

Here, every node is sum of its left and right child.
Testcase 2: Here, 1 is the root node and 4, 3 are its child nodes. 4 + 3 = 7 which is not equal to the value of root node. Hence, this tree does not satisfy the given conditions.
