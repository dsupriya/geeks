Level order traversal Line by Line 
Given a Binary Tree, your task is to print its level order traversal such that each level is separated by $.
For the below tree the output will be 1 $ 2 3 $ 4 5 6 7 $ 8 $.

          1
       /     \
     2        3
   /    \     /   \
  4     5   6    7
    \
     8

Input:
The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. For every test case, the only line of input contains a string representing the tree as described below: 

The values in the string are in the order of level order traversal of the tree where, numbers denote node values, and a character “N” denotes NULL child.

For example:

 
For the above tree, the string will be: 1 2 3 N N 4 6 N 5 N N 7 N

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, print the output in the required format.

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to read input. Just complete the function levelOrder() that takes nodes as parameter and prints level order line-by-line. The newline for every test case is automatically appended by the driver code.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= T<= 100
1 <= Number of edges <= 1000
1 <= Data of a node <= 100

Example:
Input:
2
1 4 N 4 2 
10 20 30 40 60 N N 
Output:
1 $ 4 $ 4 2 $
10 $ 20 30 $ 40 60 $

Explanation:
Testcase1: The tree is
                    1
                 /
               4
            /     \
         4        2
So, the level order would be 1 $ 4 $ 4 2 $
Testcase2: The tree is
                           10
                        /        \
                     20         30
                  /       \
               40       60
So, the level order would be 10 $ 20 30 $ 40 60 $
